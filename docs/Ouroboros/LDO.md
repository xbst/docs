# Ouroboros LDO 42STH48-2504B-EN1000 Encoder Stepper Setup

!!! warning "Make sure you have the encoder variant of the motors. They will have "-EN1000" in the part number, and will have 2 cables on the motors. Encoder is required for this application, you can't use the non-encoder 2504 motors."

**Follow the Isik's Tech encoder stepper motor guide on this website. Same values should work for these motors too.**
